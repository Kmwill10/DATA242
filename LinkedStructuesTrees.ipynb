    "## Linked Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked data structures are data structures where elements (nodes) are stored in separate memory locations and connected through references (or pointers). Unlike arrays, which have contiguous memory allocation, linked structures rely on dynamic memory allocation when each element is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linked data structures allow us to store data in interesting ways.  Let's think about this more.  Today we'll talk about how you ca create linked lists and linked trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linked Lists\n",
    "* A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains:\n",
    "    - **Data** (the actual value).\n",
    "    - **Pointer** (Reference) to the next node.  A pointer or a reference refers to where the data is stored in memory (so it is a memory address).    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Where have we seen the word reference before?\n",
    "\n",
    "(Here we are going to draw a diagram on the board.)\n",

    "* What do we need to store to create a linked list?\n",

    "    - Head of List\n",
    "      \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Linked Lists\n",
    "* Singly Linked List (SLL): Each node points to the next node.\n",
    "* Doubly Linked List (DLL): Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.\n",
    "* Circular Linked List (CLL): The last node points back to the first node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let's create our own linked list class.\n",
    "\n",
    " *  Before we do this we need to learn about one thing in Python!  How do we know if something is nothing or null?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In Python, **None** is a special value that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is similar to null in other programming languages like Java or c.\n",
