    "If you look at the implementation above NO object has been created for ValentineDelivery.  What??  I'm so confused!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, class attributes are variables defined within a class. These attributes are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed directly using the class name **without creating an instance**. This design allows for the storage of data that is common to all instances, promoting efficient memory usage and consistent behavior across objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing class attributes without creating an instance is particularly useful for defining constants or default behaviors that apply to all instances. For example, in the `ValentineDelivery class`, the `delivery_message` attribute serves as a default message for all deliveries. By referencing `ValentineDelivery.delivery_message` directly, the code retrieves this shared message without needing to instantiate the ValentineDelivery class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enhances code readability and efficiency, as it clearly indicates that the attribute is associated with the class itself rather than any particular instance. It also ensures that changes to the class attribute are reflected across all instances, maintaining consistency in scenarios where a shared attribute is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay..so now are okay with using `ValentineDelivery` in this way but what about `@classmethod`.  I can see that if I comment it out the code doesn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python,  `@classmethod` is used to define a method that is bound to the class itself, rather than to its instances.  So you can use this method if you have not created an object (or an instance of a class).  When you call a class method, the class is passed as the first argument, typically named self, allowing the method to access and modify class state that applies across all instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a weird point about Python that you can't do in other languages but it's important because Python programmers seem to employ this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another way to implement this...like I promised...\n",
    "* `Dachshund` class will represent a delivery dachshund with attributes for name, maximum gift capacity, and a list to store assigned gifts and methods to add gifts and deliver them with a personalized message.\n",
    "* The `DeliveryManager Class` will manages multiple Dachshund instances. It will also provide methods to add dachshunds, assign gifts to them, change the delivery message, and initiate the delivery process.\n"
