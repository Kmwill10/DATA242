    "Trees and heaps help with data organization, efficient searching, and prioritization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are used in hierarchical data representations (e.g., decision trees in machine learning). Binary Search Trees (BST) are a special class of trees that allow efficient searching, insertion, and deletion.  Today we'll look at an example. Tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder) is useful in many algorithms.  Tree traversals are always written recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are efficient for priority queues (used in scheduling).  You can think of priority queues as \"lines\" indicating the task or data to process next. Min-heaps and max-heaps help in quick retrieval of the smallest/largest elements.  Heaps are used in important algorithms like Dijkstra’s shortest path and Heap Sort.\n",
