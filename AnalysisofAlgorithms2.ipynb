    "##  Big-O Notation\n",
    "Big-O helps measure how an algorithm’s performance scales with input size.  Last time, we looked at code and learned how to analyze the Big-O performance. It is important to note that Big-O provides an upper bound.  In Big-O notation, the upper bound describes the worst-case scenario for an algorithm’s growth rate as the input size n increases. It provides a guarantee that an algorithm will not take more than a certain amount of time (or space), regardless of input variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "(You should always provide the tightest bound Big-O.  I'll talk about this more in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analytics, working with large datasets means understanding computational efficiency is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Big-O Complexities:\n",
    "O(1) (Constant Time): Direct access, e.g., dictionary lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(log n) (Logarithmic Time): Efficient searching, e.g., binary search (list is sorted).\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n) (Linear Time): Iterating over data, e.g., scanning a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n log n) (Log-Linear Time): Efficient sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n²) (Quadratic Time): Nested loops\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters in Data Analytics?\n",
    "1.  Helps choose the best algorithms for large datasets.\n",
    "2.  Optimizes data abstraction and data transformations.  (later we'll call this query)\n",
    "3.  Reduces runtime in machine learning preprocessing steps."
