    "# Lab:  Airline Routes Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Overview:**  \n",
    "   - Load the CSV file and print the first 10 rows.  \n",
    "   - Identify and describe the columns in the dataset. What does each column represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Descriptive Statistics:**  \n",
    "   - Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for both flight distances and ticket costs.  \n",
    "   - What do these statistics tell you about the variability in flight distances and ticket pricing?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Construction:**  \n",
    "   - Build a directed graph using NetworkX from the dataset.  \n",
    "   - Discuss the benefits of visualizing airline routes as a graph. How does this help in understanding the overall network connectivity?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Route Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, determine the shortest route (by flight distance) between `JFK` and `LAX`.  \n",
    "   - Determine the cheapest route (by ticket cost) for the same pair of airports.  \n",
    "   - Compare the two paths: Why might they differ? What factors could influence a traveler’s decision when choosing a route?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connection Metrics:**  \n",
    "   - Compute the number of outbound flights per airport. Which airport appears to be the busiest in terms of departures?  \n",
    "   - Compute the number of inbound flights per airport. Is there an airport that stands out as a major arrival hub?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cost Analysis:**  \n",
    "   - For each airport, calculate the average and standard deviation of ticket costs for outbound flights.  \n",
    "   - What might a high standard deviation indicate about ticket pricing at a specific airport?\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Visualization and Correlation:**  \n",
    "   - Plot a histogram to show the distribution of ticket costs. What does the shape of the histogram suggest about the data?  \n",
    "   - Create a scatter plot of flight distance versus ticket cost. Is there an observable correlation between the two? Discuss any trends you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Reflection and Extension:**  \n",
    "   - What insights can you draw from the differences between the shortest (by distance) route and the cheapest (by cost) route?  \n",
    "   - If you were a data analyst for an airline company, how might you use this data to inform business strategies such as pricing adjustments and route planning?  \n",
    "   - *(Optional)* Modify the dataset—either by generating additional routes or adjusting existing values—and observe how the statistics and graph change. Report your findings and insights.\n"
