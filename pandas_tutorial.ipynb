    "# Pandas and Reading Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a powerful Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. One of its key functionalities is the ability to read, process, and analyze structured data from various sources, such as CSV and Excel files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class (and probably the next class too), we will explore how to read data using Pandas and apply basic operations to understand our dataset.\n",

    "# Extracting and Reading Data in Python  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data  \n",
    "Extracting useful information from data starts with reading it into a usable format. Data can generally be classified into two types:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Data**  \n",
    "2. **Unstructured Data**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Data  \n",
    "Structured data is organized in a tabular format, where **rows** represent individual **observations** and **columns** represent **variables**. For example, the dataset below contains five observations, each representing a movie. The columns store different attributes such as title, budget, genre, and ratings. Since all attributes in a row relate to the same entity (a movie), this type of dataset is known as **relational data**.  \n",

    "Unstructured data does not follow a predefined format or structure. Examples include text files, images, audio and video recordings, and Internet of Things (IoT) data. Since analytical tools are primarily designed for structured data, analyzing unstructured data can be more challenging. However, unstructured data can often be converted into a structured format. For example, an image can be transformed into a matrix of pixel values, allowing machine learning models to classify it as a dog or a cat.\n",
